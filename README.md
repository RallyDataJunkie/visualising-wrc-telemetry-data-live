Visualising WRC Telemetry Data

See the HTML book version here: https://rallydatajunkie.com/visualising-wrc-telemetry-data/


This is based on the earlier text [Visualising WRC Telemetry Data](../visualising-wrc-telemetry-data/) which was based on a executing code within a desktop R enviornment (although I don't think I shared an environment; bah... so I maybe need to revisit that to see if I can get things working in that sort of environment...)

In this text, I intend to explore using [`quarto-live`](https://github.com/r-wasm/quarto-live) to see if I can get things executing *in the browser*.
